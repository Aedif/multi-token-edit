# Multi-Token Edit

FoundryVTT module for configuring multiple placeable objects at the same time.

## Usage

Select the placeables you wish to edit and press '**Shift+E**' _(This key binding can be changed in 'Configure Controls')_.

You will be presented with the following modified 'Configuration' window:

Common data shared between all objects will be highlighted as green, differing data as orange, and flags as purple. The newly added checkboxes to the right indicate which fields will be saved on Apply.

In addition to this key-binding Token and Tile HUDs will contain a new button if multiple tokens or tiles are selected which will also open up this modified configuration window.

An alternative to selecting placeables manually is to press '**Shift+F**' (Can also be changed in 'Configure Controls') to open a configuration window which will now allow you to perform scene wide searches using the selected fields.

Take a look at the video below to get a better idea of how the module can be used:
